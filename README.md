# Matchbox

Matchbox is a tinder bot with a few extras. Matchbox sends you an email/sms notification at the end of everyday.

## Future Potential Features
- Web based UI
- Optomize for: match count, visibility
- 

## Notes
- Prima-facie thoughts: More guys than girls, bot success will likely depend 
  on profile strength to an extent, Tinder most likely tracks user behavior in app
  to determine profile ranking,

### Online
- # of swipes / day can negatively impact you
- amount of time on a card gives algorithm impression
  you are consuming profile longer, and therefore will 
  rank you higher
- writing a description is highly rated by algorithm; algorithm likely parses description into tokens and compares them with those of other pfofiles.. matching tokens will more likely be shown to each other.
- photos are the most important aspect of a profile
